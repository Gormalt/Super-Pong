# Super-Pong
Like pong but with upgrades!
This game is written in the Processing language. Processing isn't that popular but more info on it can be found on their website.
The code comes with three files which can then be run or compiled using the processing IDE. 
This game was made by the Saint Mary's Coding Club and the management of this project was led by me, Kyle.
If you want to see the game run, you can find it on the Saint Mary's Coding Club website or here: https://www.openprocessing.org/sketch/688247
